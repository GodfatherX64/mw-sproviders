# Testing Providers

In order to test providers effectively, a built-in tool can be used which allows testing of individual source and embed providers.

There are two ways to use the tool:
- Command Line Mode - For passing in arguments directly to the script. This is useful in non-interactive environments such as CI or to repeatedly test during development.
- Question Mode - Where the script asks you questions about which source you wish to test.

::code-group
  ```bash [Interactive]
  npm run test:dev
  ```
  ```bash [Command Line]
  npm run test:dev -- [options]
  
  # Example testing FlixHQ with "Spirited Away"
  npm run test:dev -- -sid flixhq -tid 129 -t movie
  ```

The following Command Line Mode arguments are available:
